To Do

1.  Add a DeviceStateDidChange state delegate that updates the LocalBLE object.  Then have the BLE object pass it to its delegate.  This will allow the consumer to trigger code on DeviceState changes.

2. Need to setup work-in-background mode.

Design Notes

1. I think I really need to flatten connectedPeripherals and discoveredPeripherals.  My one concern was regarding connecting to a peripheral discovered during a previous session.  However, it still technically is a discoveredPeripheral, though, not from the current session.
